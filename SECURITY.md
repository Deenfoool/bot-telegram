## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this bot or its associated scripts, please report it immediately. We take all security vulnerabilities seriously.

To report a vulnerability:

- **Preferred method:** Contact the project maintainer directly via [salumbek.den@gmail.com](mailto:salumbek.den@gmail.com) or through a private message if possible.
- **Alternative:** Open a draft [Discussion](https://github.com/deenfoool/bot-telegram/discussions) describing the issue
  
Please provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it if possible.

## Response Expectations

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **12 hours** and will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability's validity and potential impact shortly after.

If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and keep you informed about the progress. If it is declined, we will explain the reason for the decision.
